      "Healthcare UX demands a paradox: calm but responsive, informative but not overwhelming. Eden's patient portal achieves this through a muted color system, breathing animations, and generous reading typography.",
      "Every animation in the system has a reduced-motion variant generated from the same GSAP tween definitions by wrapping gsap.config with a global matchMedia hook. Same code path, two experiences.",
      "Form interactions use micro-affirmations — subtle checkmarks and color shifts — to reduce the anxiety of medical data entry. Tested with patients across three clinics before launch."

    "longDescription": [
      "Built in three weeks for Paris Fashion Week, Veil handled 50,000 concurrent viewers watching a live runway stream while voting on each look in real-time. The voting UI updates live via WebSocket with optimistic UI for zero-latency feel.",
      "Between shows, the look-book builder lets viewers assemble their favorite looks into a personal digital magazine — drag-and-drop layout with GSAP Flip orchestrating the reorder animations.",
      "The entire frontend was deployed to the edge via Vercel Edge Functions with Durable Objects for real-time state, achieving sub-100ms global latency for vote tally updates during peak live moments."
